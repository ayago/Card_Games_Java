# Card Games Java

Java based Mono repository where I implement different modules relating to Card Game APIs to demonstrate and discuss my 
knowledge on DDD, Microservices, and Software Patterns in general.

Mono repository is used to facilitate modularity without the need to use an artifact repository (e.g., Nexus).

## Modules

* [Pusoy Dos Domain](pusoydos/) - Pusoy Dos rules implementation that is driven by DDD. Application development 
  framework and Infrastructure agnostic.
